  Thereâ€™s nothing like jumping in a car with your mates, turning up the tunes and singing your heart out. Last summer, Europcar asked for a UK-wide campaign to raise brand awareness amongst urban professionals. The result was branded social channels called 'Caraoke'. All that was required was to send a short video of you and friends rocking out to one of Europcar's road trip anthems. The more likes the video got, the more blog outreach it received and the more social media conversations it initiated, ultimately, meant the more chances the video had of winning special prizes, like a Fiat 500.
